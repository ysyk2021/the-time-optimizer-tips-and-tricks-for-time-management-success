Maintaining a healthy diet is crucial for providing the energy needed to tackle the day's tasks. Here are some tips for maintaining a healthy diet:

1. Eat a balanced diet: A balanced diet should include a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.

2. Create a relaxing bedtime routine: Engaging in relaxing activities such as reading or taking a warm bath before bed can help signal to your body that it's time to sleep.

3. Avoid stimulating activities before bed: Activities such as using electronic devices or engaging in intense exercise should be avoided before bedtime, as they can interfere with sleep.

4. Make sure your sleeping environment is comfortable: A cool, dark, and quiet sleeping environment can help promote better sleep.
